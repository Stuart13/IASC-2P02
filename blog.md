  As members of a discipline that has been through great developmental leaps throughout the years, digital humanists have begun to truly delve into the complexities that make up human-technology interaction from a myriad of perspectives.  These include mainly qualitative approaches that focus on the idea of interpreting human behaviour and influence regarding different texts among media.  As important as interpreting the structure and form of specific tools and behaviours can be, it is also worth noting the insights gained from hermeneutically exploring the same tools and fields of research combined with a fundamentally different academic lens.  As such, it is important to recognize the benefits of transdisciplinary studies among digital humanists and other disciplines, and how enveloping oneself into a new discourse community can influence one’s research, perspectives, and performance in their own field of study.  As much as digital humanists like to focus on the qualitative, it is the different interpretations of the quantitative “fact” in the scientific methodologies that allow for expansive research opportunities when considered.


  Van Gorp and Bron published in their article Building Bridges: Collaboration between Computer Sciences and Media Studies in a Television Archive Project the experiences of a humanist researcher and a computer scientist collaborating to develop a research tool for media studies, and how the conducted transdisciplinary work affected the developers.  An important takeaway was the idea of fluctuation between the blending of the two disciplines and learning that within development, some stages called for quantitative analysis, while other times there was a stress on the qualitative perspective (2017).  Overcoming a natural belief in the “other” (para. 39), meaning that the researchers believed their disciplines were fundamentally separate, was one of many obstacles faced throughout the process.  However, they began to realize that their differences enhanced insight into their studies.  For example, having to define each of the concepts commonly known throughout their separate discourses allowed for focused research, as no concept was left up to open interpretation (para. 52).  Further understanding of concepts through definition allows for more precise research and development within the transdisciplinary collaboration, thus improving the final product and presentation thereof.
           
           
  As noted by Alvarado,  “real digital humanists are engaged in the play of representation” as they seek to apply different concepts and tools to digital technology (2011, para.15). 
By exploring transdisciplinary studies with scientific approaches, digital humanists can dissect quantitative data found by other disciplines through a qualitative lens, or vise-versa. 
This opens many different avenues of interpretation that would usually be ignored by the digital humanities due to the use of factual data in the research.  The media researcher in Van Gorp and Bron’s article admits that the mixing of qualitative and quantitative fields is beneficial and was crucial to their tool.  She also commented on the digital humanities’ tendency to write off quantitative analysis as “superficial” due to its representation of “facts”(Van Gorp and Bron, para. 72).  As a discipline that prides itself on the interpretation and study of human interaction and behaviour, it would be counter-productive to ignore the human desire to utilize and record findings using quantitative data, as it represents a whole other field of potential interpretation that will allow digital humanists to better play with their respective representations.


  Ramsay spoke of the importance computing shares with text analysis in his article An Algorithmic Criticism.  He outlined that if text analysis were to evolve past being a fact-checker, it must “assist the critic in the unfolding of interpretative possibilities” (10).  He then proceeded to mention the ease at which computation could provide such assistance, through its ability to sort dialogue based on “most distinctive to least distinctive term” (11).  This process is important, as Ramsay is highlighting the interpretive doors studying through different disciplinary lenses can afford digital humanists.

  Figure 1 above displays the most common terms across five digital humanist articles.  When compared with figure 2, which displays the commonality of scientific terms across the same articles.  Ramsay is the outlier in his use of scientific and computational approaches to tackle a humanist action such as text analysis.
           
           
  While blending disciplines should become the next step in digital humanities analyses, it does not come without its share of struggles.  For example, the computer scientist and media researcher outlined some of their rough patches to Van Gorp and Bron, mainly surrounding their research habits and levels of understanding.  They spoke about the language barrier between their respective discourse groups. 
Although the definition of the concepts allowed for streamlined research, it was the act of having to define the concepts in the first place that sowed misunderstandings, such as different interpretations of the word “Snippet” and the function of genre (para. 49-50).  They also learned about the struggles of working with each other from a distance.  Miscommunication was common over email, so they learned that working in the same space to bounce ideas off each other was beneficial (para. 61).  This isn’t possible for all research projects and can pose a problem when it comes to communication.  However, it is the act of overcoming the barriers and truly finding a blend between disciplines that are normally considered separate, which allows researchers to create tools that can truly help others.  
As proven by the interviewees of Van Gorp and Bron, the path, although tough, is possible.  Digital humanists need to seek new avenues of interpretation to keep their research into human interactions and behaviours fresh, and by exploring transdisciplinary options, perspectives they can’t even dream of can be opened to them.
