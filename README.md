## About Me

I am a student at Brock University in the Interactive Arts and Science program.  This site showcases assignments and projects that I have created.
(If you google Kramdown flavoured markdown you'll get the styleguide)
* pwd = print working directory, tells you where you are
* ls = list, lists everything in the folder you are in
* ls -l = list, but in a nicer format
* cd = change directory, changes the folder you reside in
* . means your current directory
* .. means a directory higher than the one you are in, if you're in desktop, .. would be your user file above it
